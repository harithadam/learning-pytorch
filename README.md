# 🧠 learning-pytorch

Welcome to my PyTorch learning journey! This repository contains hands-on projects and experiments as I explore deep learning using the PyTorch framework. Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept, model, or dataset.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. Binary Classifier – Rice Type Classification
My first PyTorch project: building a neural network to classify rice grains as either **Gonen** or **Jasmine** based on shape features. This project covers:
- Data preprocessing
- Custom `Dataset` and `DataLoader`
- Neural network model design
- Training loop and loss tracking
- Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix

More projects will be added as I continue learning and experimenting with PyTorch.
